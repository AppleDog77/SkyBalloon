++Sky Balloon v1.0.0 Readme++
Created by Odie at appledog77.github.io and ladybug-lane.neocities.org

My second ever balloon! Fly into the vast blue skies with this freeballoon! I love cloudwatching, so I decided to make this for the Etc. Jam 2023. I originally didn't create this balloon for any particular ghost I'd made at the time, but now I've found it fits well with Homer Simpson. Still, feel free to use it for any ghost you wish!

This balloon is redistributable (with or without ghosts you've made), but don't delete anything! You don't have to give me credit, but if you want to, just put this somewhere on the page where you have it for download: Created by Odie Dog at Ladybug Lane. You can copy this to make your own balloon for some reason, though, instead of the amazing one at: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html, by Zarla, or the Simplicity Balloon by Zichqec at: https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/template/simplicity_balloon, which I recommend you use instead. :P The graphics are made by me, and I encourage 'em being used for anything, even stuff that's not uka-gaka related! :D
