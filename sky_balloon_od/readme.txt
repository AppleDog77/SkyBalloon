++Sky Balloon v1.0.0 Readme++
Created by Odie at odiesocean.wordpress.com and appledog77.github.io.

My second ever balloon! Fly into the vast blue skies with this freeballoon! I love cloudwatching, so I decided to make this for the Etc. Jam 2023. Doesn't go with any particular ghost I've made yet, so use it for any ghost you wish!

This balloon is redistributable, but don't delete anything! You don't have to give me credit, but if you want to, just put this somewhere on the page where you have it for download: Created by Odie at odiesocean.wordpress.com and appledog77.github.io. You can copy this to make your own balloon for some reason, though, instead of the amazing one at: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html, by Zarla, which I recommend you use instead. :P
